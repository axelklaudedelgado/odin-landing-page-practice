# odin-landing-page-practice

This is my take on the project for practicing landing page using flexbox of The Odin Project. It's not perfect, but I learned a lot in doing it. I think I would still need to fix some properties here and there as I go along the course. Nonetheless, it was a fun and hard experience.
